# The Basic PDFReader To Speak
# the basic purpose of this app code is to reader the PDF and speak out
# Two modules are used to achieve this functionality

import pyttsx3
# The pyttsx3 or the Python Text to Speech modules helps with conversion of text to speech

import PyPDF2
# This module helps on reading the PDF files

book = open('c.pdf', 'rb')
# Here this line of code clearly mentions that a variable book is taken to read book(rb) with the mention of the file name

pdfReader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(book)
# As the book is open here variable pdfReader is used to store the book
pages = pdfReader.numPages
# This line gets the number of pages in the PDF
print(pages)
# Printing of total number of pages
pageNo = int(input('Enter the page no to start from: '))
# Here is the mention from which page number to start
print(pageNo)
# Print the asked number of page by users
speaker = pyttsx3.init()
# Here starts the speaker
for num in range(pageNo, pages):
    page = pdfReader.getPage(pageNo)
    text = page.extractText()
    print('Speaking......')
    speaker.say(text)
    speaker.runAndWait()
# The above module counts and keep reading the PDF till the end of the PDF pages.
# However this could easily be changed to.
